OSG 23 News
===========

**Supported OS Versions:** EL8, EL9 (see [this document](supported_platforms.md) for details)

OSG 23 is the first release series that follows our new [support policy](release_series.md), which aims to increase the
regularity of the OSG Software Stack lifecycle.
Moving forward, we plan to distribute a new release series each year, supporting each release series for approximately 2
years total.
As with OSG 3.6, we will continue to release OSG 23 package updates in a rolling fashion.

Additionally, OSG 23 aligns the OSG and HTCondor Software Suite (HTCSS) release cycles:

-   OSG 23 main Yum repositories will contain HTCSS LTS series
    ([HTCondor 23.0](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/23.0/index.html),
    [HTCondor-CE 23.0](https://htcondor.com/htcondor-ce/v23/installation/htcondor-ce/))
-   OSG 23 upcoming Yum repositories will contain HTCSS feature series (HTCondor 23.x, HTCondor-CE 23.x)

    As part of our transition to our new series release cadence, we are planning to end support for OSG 3.6 on 30 June
    2024 to align with the EL7 end-of-life.
    See our [release series life-cycle](release_series.md#series-life-cycle) table for details.

The initial release of OSG 23 contains [major package updates](#major-package-updates) and
[package removals](#package-removals).
All other packages may have received minor version and/or packaging updates compared to OSG 3.6.

#### Major package updates ####

This release contains the following major package updates compared to the current OSG 3.6 release:

-   [HTCondor 23.0.0](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/23.0/version-history/lts-versions-23-0.html#version-23-0-0):
    an update from 10.0.8 in OSG 3.6 main and 10.8.0 in OSG 3.6 upcoming.
    -   New features
        -   A `condor_startd` without any slot types defined will now default to a single partitionable slot rather than a
            number of static slots equal to the number of cores as it was in previous versions.
            The configuration template use `FEATURE : StaticSlots` was added for admins wanting the old behavior.
        -   The `TargetType` attribute is no longer a required attribute in most Classads.
            It is still used for queries to the `condor_collector` and it remains in the Job ClassAd and the Machine
            ClassAd because of older versions of HTCondor require it to be present.
        -   The `-dry-run option` of `condor_submit` will now print the output of a `SEC_CREDENTIAL_STORER script`.
            This can be useful when developing such a script.
        -   Added ability to query epoch history records from the python bindings.
        -   The default value of `SEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS` will now be visible in `condor_config_val`.
            The default for `SEC_*_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS will` inherit from this value, and thus no `READ` and `CLIENT`
            will no longer automatically have `CLAIMTOBE`.
        -   Added new tool `condor_test_token`, which will create a SciToken with configurable contents (including
            issuer) which will be accepted for a short period of time by the local HTCondor daemons.
    -   Bug fixes
        -   Fixed a bug that would cause the condor_startd to crash in rare cases when jobs go on hold
        -   Fixed a bug where if a user-level checkpoint could not be transferred from the starter to the AP, the job
            would go on hold
            Now it will retry, or go back to idle
        -   Fixed a bug where the `CommittedTime` attribute was not set correctly for Docker Universe jobs doing user
            level check-pointing
        -   Fixed a bug where `condor_preen` was deleting files named 'OfflineAds' in the spool directory
        -   Fixed a bug where the blahpd would incorrectly believe that an LSF batch scheduler was not working
        -   Fixed the Execution Pointâ€™s detection of whether libvirt is working properly for the VM universe
        -   Fixed a bug where container universe did not work for late materialization jobs submitted to the
            `condor_schedd`
        -   Fixed a bug where the condor_startd could crash if a new match is made at the end a drain request

-   [HTCondor-CE 23.0.0](https://htcondor.com/htcondor-ce/v23/installation/htcondor-ce/):
    an update from 6.0.0 in OSG 3.6 main.

    !!! warning "Job router configuration deprecation"
        The configuration macros `JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS`, `JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES`, `JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES_CMD`, and
        `JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES_FILE` are deprecated and will be removed for V24 of HTCondor.
        New configuration syntax for the job router is defined using `JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_NAMES` and
        `JOB_ROUTER_ROUTE_<name>`.
        Note: The removal will occur during the lifetime of the HTCondor V23 feature series, i.e. the versions that will
        be available in OSG upcoming repositories.

    -   Adds deprecation warnings for old job router configuration syntax
    -   Adds grid CA and host certificate/key locations to default SSL search paths
    -   Verifies that HTCondor-CE can access the local HTCondor's `SPOOL` directory on startup
    -   `condor_ce_upgrade_check` checks compatibility with HTCondor 23
    -   Adds an option to allow running `condor_ce_trace` without a SciToken for testing batch system integration

-   [XRootD 5.6.2](https://github.com/xrootd/xrootd/blob/v5.6.2/docs/ReleaseNotes.txt#L1-L123):
    an update from XRootD 5.5.1 in OSG 3.6 main.

        -   Increase default number of parallel event loops to 10
        -   xrdcp: number of parallel copy jobs increased from 4 to 128
        -   Allow XRootD to return trailers indicating failure
        -   Denote Accept-Ranges in HEAD response
        -   Report cache object age for caching proxy mode
        -   Allow origin to be a directory of a locally mounted file system
        -   Implement ability to have the token username as a separate claim
        -   Use SHA-256 for signatures, and message digest algorithm
        -   Allow option '-tokenlib none' to disable token validation
        -   Allow to point to a token file using CGI `'?xrd.ztn=tokenfile'`
    -   Major bug fixes
        -   Fix SEGV in case request has object for opaque data but no content
        -   Fix memory leaks in GSI authentication
        -   Fix chunked PUT creating empty files

-   [GlideinWMS 3.10.5](http://glideinwms.fnal.gov/doc.v3_10_5/history.html):
    an update from 3.10.1 in OSG 3.6 main
    
    !!! warning "If you are using custom setup scripts..."
        If you are using custom setup scripts please change the use of `glidein_config`:

        -   Custom scripts should always read values via `gconfig_get()`.
            The only exception is the parsing of the line to get the `add_config_line` source file.
        -   `add_config_line` is deprecated in favor of `gconfig_add`.
            `add_config_line` will be removed from future versions.
        -   `add_config_line_safe` is deprecated in favor of `gconfig_add_safe`.
            `gconfig_add` is the recommended method to use also in concurrent scripts.
        -   Custom scripts in Python should `import gconfig.py` (compatible with both Python 2 and 3) and use the
            provided functions or classes: `gconfig_get`, `gconfig_add`, etc.

    -   This release completes EL9 and Python 3.9 support
    -   Added structured logging
